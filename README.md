I implemented it in 5 minutes.

Because of some symbols cannot be used it have different syntax:

Braisnplosion | Brainsplosion in batch
| - | -
| + | i
| - | d
| < | m
| > | v
| . | o

, are not implemented. Commands seperated by space
# Usage
On line 5 change "i i i i i i m i i i i i o i o d o i i o d d o "(that code prints ABACA) to your progam and run file.
